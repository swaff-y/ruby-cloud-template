# ruby-cloud-template

This repository is a comprehensive solution for building and deploying a robust REST API using AWS, Ruby, and MongoDB. It utilizes an efficient build pipeline with Buildkite to streamline the development process and supports the deployment of both development and production branches. The deployment process is powered by Serverless, ensuring seamless integration with AWS infrastructure.

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, providing a structured and scalable codebase. The MVC pattern separates the concerns of data management (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (Controller), resulting in a highly maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Key Features:
- **AWS Integration:** Leveraging the power of Amazon Web Services, the repository enables seamless deployment and management of your REST API.
- **Ruby Programming Language:** Built using the Ruby programming language, the repository takes advantage of its elegant syntax, flexibility, and extensive community support.
- **MongoDB Database:** The repository utilizes MongoDB, a scalable and high-performance NoSQL database, for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Build Pipeline with Buildkite:** The build pipeline, integrated with Buildkite, automates the build and testing processes, ensuring reliable and error-free code deployment.
- **Serverless Deployment:** By utilizing Serverless, the repository enables hassle-free deployment to AWS, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing operational overhead.

This repository serves as an ideal solution for developers looking to build REST APIs with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. Whether you're starting a new project or enhancing an existing one, this repository provides a solid foundation for building powerful and reliable APIs.
