# ruby-cloud-template

This repository is a comprehensive solution for building and deploying a robust REST API using AWS, Ruby, and MongoDB. It utilizes an efficient build pipeline with Buildkite to streamline the development process and supports the deployment of both development and production branches. The deployment process is powered by Serverless, ensuring seamless integration with AWS infrastructure.

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, providing a structured and scalable codebase. The MVC pattern separates the concerns of data management (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (Controller), resulting in a highly maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Key Features:
- **AWS Integration:** Leveraging the power of Amazon Web Services, the repository enables seamless deployment and management of your REST API.
- **Ruby Programming Language:** Built using the Ruby programming language, the repository takes advantage of its elegant syntax, flexibility, and extensive community support.
- **MongoDB Database:** The repository utilizes MongoDB, a scalable and high-performance NoSQL database, for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Build Pipeline with Buildkite:** The build pipeline, integrated with Buildkite, automates the build and testing processes, ensuring reliable and error-free code deployment.
- **Serverless Deployment:** By utilizing Serverless, the repository enables hassle-free deployment to AWS, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing operational overhead.

This repository serves as an ideal solution for developers looking to build REST APIs with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. Whether you're starting a new project or enhancing an existing one, this repository provides a solid foundation for building powerful and reliable APIs.

### Setting Up a Buildkite Pipeline

To set up a Buildkite pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for Buildkite**: Go to the Buildkite website ([https://buildkite.com/](https://buildkite.com/)) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.

2. **Create a Buildkite pipeline**: Once you're logged in, click on "New Pipeline" to create a new pipeline.

3. **Connect your repository**: Select the version control system (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) where your repository is hosted. Authenticate with your account and select the repository you want to connect.

4. **Configure your pipeline**: Buildkite provides a YAML-based pipeline configuration file (usually named `buildkite.yml`) to define your pipeline's steps and actions. Create this file in the root directory of your repository.

5. **Define pipeline steps**: In the `buildkite.yml` file, define the steps of your pipeline. These steps typically include tasks like building the code, running tests, and deploying the application. Each step can be customized with specific commands and environment settings.

6. **Commit and push the configuration file**: Commit the `buildkite.yml` file to your repository and push the changes. Buildkite will automatically detect the new file and use it to configure your pipeline.

7. **Configure build triggers**: Configure the trigger rules for your pipeline. This specifies when and under what conditions the pipeline should be triggered. You can set triggers based on branch names, tags, or specific events in your version control system.

8. **Configure agents**: Buildkite uses agents to execute the pipeline steps. Agents can be hosted on your own infrastructure or provided by Buildkite. Configure the agents based on your requirements, such as the number of concurrent builds, operating system, and environment.

9. **Save and activate the pipeline**: Once you've configured all the necessary settings, save the pipeline configuration. Activate the pipeline to make it active and ready to run.

10. **Test and iterate**: Trigger a build to test your pipeline. Monitor the build output, logs, and any potential issues. Iterate on your pipeline configuration as needed to refine and improve the build process.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a Buildkite pipeline to automate your build, test, and deployment processes.
